# JOBDD

**JOBDD** is a Java-based framework designed to facilitate Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for Java applications. It provides a simple and effective way to define and execute test cases that describe the desired behavior of your application. This framework aims to bridge the gap between business stakeholders and developers by allowing everyone to understand the specifications clearly.

## Features

- **Simple Syntax**: Define your tests in a natural language style (Gherkin syntax), making them easy to read and understand for non-technical stakeholders.
- **JUnit Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with JUnit, allowing you to run your BDD tests as part of your standard testing suite.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize the framework settings to suit your project's specific needs and requirements.
- **Extensible**: Add your own steps, hooks, and custom logic to enhance functionality and cater to unique scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with JOBDD, follow these instructions to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher is required.
- **Maven**: Make sure Maven is installed for building the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the JOBDD repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomtastisch/JOBDD.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:
Change into the directory of the cloned repository:

cd JOBDD


	3.	Build the project using Maven:
Execute the following command to build the project:

mvn clean install

This command compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application.

Usage

Once you have JOBDD set up in your project, follow these steps to start using it.

Adding JOBDD to Your Project

	1.	Add the JOBDD dependency to your pom.xml file:
Open your pom.xml file and include the following dependency:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>jobdd</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>

Replace 1.0.0 with the actual version if necessary.

Writing Feature Files

	2.	Create your feature files:
Create feature files in the src/test/resources/features directory. Here’s an example of how a feature file might look using Gherkin syntax:

Feature: Sample Feature

  Scenario: Sample Scenario
    Given a precondition
    When an action is performed
    Then expect a result



Implementing Step Definitions

	3.	Implement your step definitions in Java:
In your Java project, create a class to implement the step definitions corresponding to the steps in your feature files. Here’s an example:

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;

public class StepDefinitions {

    @Given("a precondition")
    public void givenAPrecondition() {
        // Code for the precondition
        System.out.println("Precondition met.");
    }

    @When("an action is performed")
    public void whenAnActionIsPerformed() {
        // Code for the action
        System.out.println("Action performed.");
    }

    @Then("expect a result")
    public void thenExpectAResult() {
        // Code for the expected result
        assertTrue("Expected result", true);
    }
}



Running Your Tests

	4.	Run your tests with JUnit:
You can run your tests using JUnit from your IDE or using Maven in the terminal:

mvn test
